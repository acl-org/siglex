## Lexical Resources

SIGLEX used to maintain a list of lexical resources.
With the advent of [LRE Map](https://lremap.elra.info/), this list is no longer maintained.

We find that the graded responses correlate with annotations from previous datasets, but sense assignments are used in a way that weakens the case for clear cut sense boundaries. The responses from both experiments correlate with the overlap of paraphrases from the English lexical substitution task which bodes well for the use of substitutes as a proxy for word sense.">Details</a>

Also, while purporting to retain the richness of semantic information in FN, JFN pays close attention to typological differences in lexicalization patterns between Japanese and English.

The data elements in the lexicon describe syntactic characteristics of each entry, including inflection codes, case, gender, syntactic category, complements for verbs and nouns, modification types for adverbs, and more. This is lexicon was developed as a free, publicly available resource, with only moderate restrictions (e.g., you can't claim it as your own).

All information available in WordNet has been converted into DIMAP format. All hypernyms have been entered as DIMAP superconcepts; all hyponyms as DIMAP instances; and all other relations (synonyms, meronyms, holonyms,troponyms, antonyms, pertainyms, entailments, causes, similars, and also sees) as distinct DIMAP roles. All verb frames have been explicitly converted into various kinds of features in DIMAP senses, with complex frames explicitly represented as collocation patterns. Each sense has been explicitly identified with an id feature corresponding to the WordNet file number and sense number. Adjective types are explicitly identified in DIMAP features. Glosses have been taken apart into definitional components, example usages, and grammatical patterns (usually prepositional accompaniments). A separate Heads dictionary contains one sense for each word that appears as either the final word of mutiword and hyphenated noun and adjective entries or the first word of multiword verb entries.

The first corpus covers 34 prepositions, while the latter two include all single-word prepositions and many phrasal prepositions. Each corpus consists of sentences following the SemEval format. In addition, each sentence has been lemmatized, part-of-speech tagged, and parsed with a dependency parser.">Details</a>
