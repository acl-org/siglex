The Vice-President Elect and the Vice-Secretary Elect will automatically become President and Secretary, respectively, upon the completion of their 2-year term, and they will serve in these new positions during the following 2-year term. This would ensure the institutional memory of the SIGLEX board.

Votes may be entered by electronic or physical mail, and votes arriving by the notified closing date will be counted by a returning officer appointed by the President and agreed to by all candidates. Nominations shall be called at least three months prior to the election, and shall close two months prior to the election. All members shall be notified of the election date and the nominations at least four weeks prior to the close of voting, and results shall be notified to the members within four weeks after the close of voting.

### V. Dues
Subject to the approval of the Executive Committee of the ACL the SIG may levy annual membership dues, where the rate is determined by the Executive Committee. In certain circumstances, the Executive Committee may decide to waive the fee.

### VI. Referenda
A change to this constitution, or a motion on any other matter, may be initiated by five members (petitioners) in writing or by agreement of the President and Secretary (on the suggestion of a member or otherwise). The motions will be put to the members within six months of receipt of a petition, if the petitioners so request. Otherwise, constitutional amendments and other motions will be put to the vote in conjunction with the regular elections.

All members shall be notified of the date of the referendum and the proposed motions and amendments at least four weeks prior to the close of voting, and results shall be notified to the members within four weeks of the close of voting.

Any change to this constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the SIGLEX membership and is subject to approval by ACL. Any other matter requires a simple majority of those actually voting.

Notification shall signify dispatch of mail by the medium and to the address last notified to the secretary.

### VII. SIG Sections
SIGLEX will have an internal structure in the form of Sections. SIGLEX will maintain a list of active Sections. Each Section will have a statement of purpose which is in agreement with point I of this constitution. The Sections will maintain a website and a list of members. In order to be a Section member one needs to be a SIGLEX member as well. Each section will elect a Section representative who will then be an officer of SIGLEX.

In order to create a Section, the SIGLEX board (all elected officers) must approve its creation.

A Section will cease to exist if any of the following requirements is not met:
* The website is not updated at least annually.
* The membership list is not updated annually.
* The Section does not perform any activity with the collaboration of SIGLEX.
* The Section no longer reflects an area of active research of interest to the SIGLEX community.

In addition, the SIGLEX board can decide to cancel a Section after a reasoned debate.
