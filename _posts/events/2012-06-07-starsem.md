The main goal of *SEM is to provide a stable forum for the 
growing number of NLP researchers working on different 
aspects of semantic processing, which has been scattered 
over a large array of small workshops and conferences.

The first edition of *SEM will be a two-day conference 
collocated with the North American Chapter of the 
Association for Computational Linguistics and Human Language Technologies 2012 conference (NAACL HLT), which will take place in Montreal, Canada.
