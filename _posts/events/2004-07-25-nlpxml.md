While “plain XML” has become the established standard for data representation, especially for purposes of interchange and software interoperability, the use of RDF (Resource Definition Framework), RDFS (RDF Schema) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) for NLP applications remains relatively limited. However, the combination of XML, RDF/RDFS and OWL provides an overall architecture for NLP resources of all kinds whose implications are still being worked out within the NLP community.

NLPXML-2004 provides a forum for presentation and discussion of practical applications of RDF, RDFS and OWL in NLP. The workshop is intended not only for those already using Semantic Web technologies, but also members of the NLP community who seek a fuller understanding of the
motivations and implications of these standards for the field.

The workshop program is designed to move progressively from XML, via metadata and RDF, to ontologies and OWL, and finally to their combined use for NLP applications. In this way, the workshop aims to clarify the respective roles of XML, RDF/RDFS and OWL in language technology, in relation
to the growth of the Semantic Web.
