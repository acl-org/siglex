We are pleased to announce that SIGLEX and SIGSEM, special interest groups of the ACL, are organizing the fourth joint conference on lexical and computational semantics: *SEM (pronounced "starsem"). This time *SEM will be collocated with NAACL in Denver, Colorado.

*SEM brings together researchers interested in the semantics of natural languages and its computational modeling. The conference embraces symbolic and probabilistic approaches, and everything in between; theoretical contributions as well as practical applications are welcome. The long-term goal of *SEM is to provide a stable forum for the growing number of NLP researchers working on all aspects of semantics.
