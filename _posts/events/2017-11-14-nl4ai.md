INTRODUCTION
The goal of the workshop “Natural Language for Artificial 
Intelligence” (NL4AI) is to explore the area situated at the 
intersection between Natural Language Processing and 
Artificial Intelligence. Even though we acknowledge the 
existence of a promising ground where these two disciplines 
can benefit from each other, we also believe this area is not 
only "populated" of technological challenges that, at turn, 
make one discipline play an ancillary role for the other. In 
fact, we believe that at the crossroad between NLP and AI, 
new technological paradigms rise from a cross-fertilization 
where each discipline makes a equal contribution: these 
resulting methodologies and technologies can change our 
reality and their societal impact has not yet been fully-
fledged.
 
TOPICS OF INTEREST
We invite papers that pertain to the workshop theme including 
but not limited to:
- Cognitive modeling and psycholinguistics
- NLP and AI applications in the Web era
- Natural Language Interfaces for Human Robot Interaction
- Speech for Conversational Agents or Human Robot Interaction 
Language, Vision and Cognition 
- Resources and evaluation for NLP based AI systems
- Position papers on the role of NLP in AI and societal 
impact
- Dialog and interactive systems
- Discourse and Pragmatics
- Natural Language Generation
- Information extraction and general NLP and AI applications 
including but not limited to text mining, semantic analytics, 
question answering, document analysis, text categorization, 
topic models, retrieval
- Machine Learning for NLP
- Sentiment analysis and Opinion mining
- Natural Language Inference
- Natural Language Processing and Industrial Challenges
 
HOW TO SUBMIT
Position and Short paper: 6 pages
Demos: 6 pages
Long papers: 12 pages
We encourage submissions that describe new theoretical 
models, applied techniques, and research in progress. 
However, contributions that have been already published or 
presented in other locations are welcomed. Depending if the 
authors transferred the right of publishing their work 
exclusively to a specific editor (e.g. IEEE/ACM conferences 
and journals), we might not be able to include the submission 
into the proceedings. In such a case, the work will be only 
mentioned in the proceedings.
Submissions should be prepared according to the main 
conference format (Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science). All submissions should be written in English and 
submitted as PDF. Submissions will be peer reviewed (single-
blind) by the program committee members. Evaluation criteria 
will include novelty, significance for theory/practice, 
technical soundness, and quality of presentation. All the 
submissions should be submitted via EasyChair: 
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nl4ai> 
At least one author of an accepted paper must attend the 
workshop to present the work.
The accepted papers will be published in the workshop 
proceedings via CEUR Workshop Proceedings. We will also 
consider editing a special issue on The Italian Journal of 
Computational Linguistics (<http://www.ai-lc.it/it/rivista)> 
after the workshop by encouraging the participants to extend 
their papers.
