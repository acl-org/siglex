MWEs are increasingly being singled out as a problem for NLP, particularly for the many applications which require some degree of semantic interpretation and require tasks such as parsing and word sense disambiguation. In the call for papers we solicited papers that especially laid emphasis on integrating analysis, acquisition and treatment of various kinds of multiword expressions in natural language NLP. For example, research that combines a linguistic analysis with a method of automatically acquiring the classes described, work that combines the computational treatment of a class of MWEs with a solid linguistic analysis and research that extracts MWEs and
either classifies them or uses them in some task.
