The University of Oxford will host the Ninth International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS-2011), which will take place at the Computing Laboratory on 12-14 January 2011.  The aim of the IWCS conference is to bring together researchers interested in any aspects
of the computation, annotation, extraction, and representation of meaning in natural language, whether this is from a lexical or structural semantic perspective. IWCS embraces both symbolic and statistical approaches to computational semantics, and everything in between.
