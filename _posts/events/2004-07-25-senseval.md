SENSEVAL-3 was very successful. Fourteen different tasks were organized and 55 teams participated with over 160 systems. Tasks included core word sense disambiguation tasks
for various languages (Basque, Catalan, Chinese, English, Italian, Romanian, Spanish), and new tasks involving identification of semantic roles, logic forms, multilingual annotations, and subcategorization acquisition.

The papers represent a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods for word sense disambiguation and semantic analysis. These proceedings include the descriptions of ALL tasks and systems participating in the evaluation.
