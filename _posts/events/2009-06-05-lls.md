The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working in topics related to the unsupervised and minimally supervised learning of the semantics of lexical items. These include learning of word meanings, learning of lexical relationships (e.g. hyponym, meronym, antonym learning), learning of idiomatic and multi-word expressions, learning of bilingual lexicons etc.

Each of these topics have so far been covered in diverse venues eg. WordNet conferences, SemEval, EMNLP etc. but has lacked a focussed venue that brings together the issues and methods relevant to lexical semantics within a single venue. In the past few years there has been a surge of interest in unsupervised and minimally supervised methods in natural language processing. The proposed worshop will help focus on methods that are suitable in learning of lexical semantics.
