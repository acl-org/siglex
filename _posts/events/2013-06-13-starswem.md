The main goal of *SEM is to provide a stable forum for the growing number of NLP researchers working on different aspects of semantic processing. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Formal and linguistic semantics, Cognitive aspects of semantics, Lexical semantics, Semantic aspects of morphology and semantic processing of morphologically rich languages, Semantic processing at the sentence level, Semantic processing at the discourse level, Semantic processing of non-propositional aspects of meaning, Textual entailment, Multiword expressions, Multilingual semantic processing, and Social media and linguistic semantics. *SEM 2013 hosts the shared task on Semantic Textual Similarity.
