The definition and detection of events have their roots in philosophy and linguistics, with seminal works by Davidson (1969, 1985), Quine (1985) and Parsons (1990), and have long been a subject of study.  However, the NLP community has yet to achieve a consensus on the treatment of events, in spite of its critical importance to several areas in natural language processing, such as topic detection and tracking (Allan et al., 1998), information extraction (Humphreys et al., 1997), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), textual entailment (Haghighi et al., 2005), and contradiction detection (de Marneffe et al., 2008). The time is ripe to bring together interested parties for a serious discussion of appropriate guidelines, resources, and processes for defining and detecting events and their coreferences, and how they should be represented. This is a genuine “working” workshop on this topic. The organizers, with the assistance of the program committee, have organized a small shared annotation task on event mention and coreference annotation.
