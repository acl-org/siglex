The European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) invites everyone interested in machine translation and translation-related tools and resources ― developers, researchers, users, translation and localization professionals and managers ― to participate in this conference.

Driven by the state of the art, the research community will demonstrate their cutting-edge research and results. Professional machine translation users will provide insight into successful MT implementation of machine translation (MT) in business scenarios as well as implementation scenarios involving large corporations, governments, or NGOs. Translation studies scholars and translation practitioners are also invited to share their first-hand MT experience, which will be addressed during a special track.

From 1-3 June 2022, the 23rd Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT 2022) will take place in Ghent! The conference is co-organised by LT3 and CrossLang and is a unique opportunity for researchers, developers, and users of machine translation to exchange knowledge and ideas.
