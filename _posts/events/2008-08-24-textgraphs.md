Recent years have shown an increased interest in bringing the field of graph theory into Natural Language Processing. In many NLP applications entities can be naturally represented as nodes in a graph and relations between them can be represented as edges. Recent research has shown that graph-based representations of linguistic units as diverse as words, sentences and documents give rise to novel
and efficient solutions in a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from part of speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and parsing to information extraction, semantic role assignment, summarization and sentiment analysis. The contribution of the graph representation, in addition to its intuitiveness, resides in the possibility to relate linguistic entities beyond pairwise comparison.

The workshop aimed at bringing together researchers working on problems related to the use of graph-based algorithms for Natural Language Processing and on the theory of graph-based methods. It addressed a broad spectrum of research areas to foster exchange of ideas and to help identify principles of using the graph notions that go beyond an ad-hoc usage.
