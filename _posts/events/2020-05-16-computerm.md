Workshop on Computational Terminology CompuTerm 2020
	and its share task TermEval

 LREC 2020 (Marseille, France)
 Saturday, 16th May 2019
 Marseille, France
 <https://sites.google.com/view/computerm2020>

!! Extended submission date : 1st March 2020

The aim of this sixth Computerm workshop is to bring together 
Natural Language Processing and Human Language Technology 
researchers as well as terminology researchers and practitioners 
to 
discuss recent advances in computational terminology and its 
impact within automatic and human applications. We also host a 
special session for the shared task TermEval, which uses the 
large, 
manually annotated ACTER dataset (Annotated Corpora for Term 
Extraction Research), that covers multiple domains and 
languages.

For the general session, we call for submissions in the following 
areas, though the list does not limit the range of topics:

   * term extraction
   * event recognition and extraction
   * acquisition of semantic relations among terms
   * distributional semantic analysis
   * term variation management
   * definition and terminological context extraction
   * consideration of the user expertise
   * monolingual and multilingual terminological resources
   * robustness and portability of statistical methods including 
neural 
methods
   * detection of unfortunate terminological artefacts
   * social networks and modern media processing
   * utilization of terminologies in various NLP applications
   * evaluation of terminological methods and tools
   * terminology diversity according to geographical area, 
layman/academic, gender

The workshop submissions are open to different approaches, 
ranging from term extraction in various languages (using verb co-
occurrence, information theoretic approaches, machine learning, 
etc.), translation pairs extracting from bilingual corpora based on 
terminology, up to semantic oriented approaches and theoretical 
aspects of terminology.

Computerm 2020 will host the TermEval shared task on 
monolingual 
term extraction using the ACTER dataset. This dataset contains 
over 
100k manual annotations in comparable corpora in three different 
languages (English, French, and Dutch) and four different 
domains 
(corruption, dressage, heart failure, and wind energy). 
Participants 
in the shared task can enter for one or multiple languages and will 
get access to the annotated data in three of the domains, while 
the 
domain of heart failure will be provided at a  later stage for 
evaluation. 
All information concerning the shared task is available on 
<http://termeval.ugent.be>
Authors may submit system description papers to CompuTerm 
2020 
indicating TermEval shared task.
