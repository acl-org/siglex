The workshop is aimed at enhancing the linguistic dimension in the CL 
spectrum, as well as at strengthening the focus on explanatory rather than 
engineering aspects. The broader theme concerns the relations between 
GRAMMAR and LEXICON, but the workshop is supposed to be 
specifically focused 
on burning issues from that domain such as:
** Linguistically oriented issues: valency, and some related special 
linguistic phenomena such as diathesis; lexicon and morphology (incl. 
derivational morphology and morphosyntactic features in lexicons and 
their 
relation to semantics); lexicons and discourse (e.g. connectors, alternative 
connecting means);
** Lexicon/Grammar interface: types of information in lexical entries; 
linguistic vs. encyclopaedic information in the dictionary; syntax and 
phraseology (microsyntax), the grammar of idioms;
** Computationally related issues: the role of lexicons in grammar 
formalisms; lexicons and grammars vs. corpora and treebanks; annotation 
standards; valency dictionaries;
** Semantically driven issues such as semantic representation and 
lexically-
supported inference;
** NLP oriented topics: use of lexicons, gazeteers and other man-made or 
machine-learnt lexical resources in NLP applications; multiword 
expressions 
in lexicons and grammars.
The workshop is intended as a lively forum touching upon issues that 
might 
be of interest (and, possibly, an inspiration for application both in theory 
and in practice) for a broader research community with different 
background: 
linguistic, computational or natural language processing.
