Computational and Corpus-based Phraseology (Europhras 2019)

Malaga, Spain, 25-27 September 2019  
<http://www.lexytrad.es/europhras2019>  

The conference will focus on interdisciplinary approaches to phraseology and invites submissions on a wide range of topics, covering, but not limited to: computational, corpus-based, psycholinguistic and cognitive approaches to the study of phraseology, and practical applications in computational linguistics, translation, lexicography and language learning, teaching and assessment.

These topics cover include the following:
 * Computational approaches to the study of multiword expressions, e.g. automatic detection, classification and extraction of multiword expressions; automatic translation of multiword expressions; computational treatment of proper names; multiword expressions in NLP tasks and applications such as parsing, machine translation, text summarisation, term extraction, web search;
 * Corpus-based approaches to phraseology, e.g. corpus-based empirical studies of phraseology, task-orientated typologies of phraseological units (e.g. for annotation, lexicographic representation, etc.), annotation schemes, applications in applied linguistics and more specifically translation, interpreting, lexicography, terminology, language learning, teaching and assessment (see also below);
 * Phraseology in mono- and bilingual lexicography and terminography, e.g. new forms of presenting phraseological units in dictionaries and other lexical resources based on corpus-based and corpus-driven approaches; domain-specific terminology;
 * Phraseology in translation and cross-linguistic studies, e.g. use parallel and comparable corpora for translating phraseological units; phraseological units in computer-aided translation; study of phraseology across languages;
 * Phraseology in specialised languages and language dialects, e.g. phraseology of specialised languages, study of phraseological use in different dialects or varieties of a specific language;
 * Phraseology in language learning, teaching and assessment: e.g. second language/bilingual processing of phraseological units and formulaic language; phraseological units in learner language;
 * Theoretical and descriptive approaches to phraseology, e.g. phraseological units and the lexis-grammar interface, the relevance of phraseology for theoretical models of grammar, the representation of phraseological units in constituency and dependency theories, phraseology and its interaction with semantics;
 * Cognitive and psycholinguistic approaches: e.g. cognitive models of phraseological unit comprehension and production; on-line measures of phraseological unit processing (e.g. eye tracking, event-related potentials, self-paced reading); phraseology and language disorders; phraseology and text readability;

The above list is indicative and not exhaustive. Any submission presenting a study related to the alternative terms of phraseological units, multiword expressions, multiword units, formulaic language, or polylexical expressions, will be considered.

SUMBMISSIONS ADN PUBLICATION

The conference invites submissions reporting original unpublished work.

EUROPHRAS 2019 invites four types of submissions: regular papers, short papers, poster papers and abstracts.
 * Regular papers should not exceed 15 pages including references; their minimum length is 12 pages. All accepted regular papers will be published in a Springer LNAI volume, which will be available at the time of the conference. Regular papers must be written in English. Participants presenting regular papers can also benefit from post-EUROPHRAS 2019 publication opportunities (please see conditions below).
 * Short papers should not exceed 7 pages excluding references; they should be at least 5 pages long. All accepted short papers will be published in conference e-proceedings with an ISBN identifier and will also be made available at the time of the conference. Short papers can be written in either English or Spanish. Participants presenting short papers at the conference can also benefit from post-EUROPHRAS 2019 publication opportunities (please see conditions below).
 * Poster papers should not exceed 4 pages excluding references. All accepted papers for poster presentations will be included in the conference e-proceedings alongside short papers. Poster papers can be written in either English or Spanish. Participants presenting posters at the conference can also benefit from post-EUROPHRAS 2019 publication opportunities (please see conditions below).

In line with the tradition of previous EUROPHRAS conferences, abstracts about 500 words excluding references will be also considered for presentation at the conference. The submission deadline for abstracts will be one month later than the rest of the submissions and they can be written in either English or Spanish. The accepted abstracts will not be published in the Springer volume or the e-proceedings which will be available at the time of the conference, but as aforementioned, their authors can benefit from post-EUROPHRAS 2019 publication opportunities (please see conditions below).
Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the Programme Committee. All submissions must be made online using the Softconf START conference management system. For further instructions, please refer to the submission guidelines.

Authors of accepted papers will receive further instructions on how to produce camera-ready versions of their papers for inclusion in the proceedings.
