In this workshop we aim at bringing together researchers working on negation and speculation from any area related to computational language learning and processing. The general goal of the workshop is to stimulate research about these topics. Specific goals are to describe the lexical aspects of negation and speculation, to define how the semantics of these phenomena can be modelled for computational purposes, to explore techniques aimed at learning the factuality of an statement, and to analyse how the treatment of these phenomena affects the efficiency of NLP applications. Finally, the workshop aims at encouraging discussion about the need of deep linguistic processing as a way to take computational linguistics a step further.
