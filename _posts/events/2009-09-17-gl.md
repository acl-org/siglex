The goal of the GL conferences is to bring together diverse
contributions from theoretical and computational linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, and lexicography, which explore compositionality from the point of view of generative approaches to the lexicon.  Historically, contributions have assumed, as a starting point, the view outlined in Generative Lexicon theory (Pustejovsky, 1995, 2001). This year's GL conference will be in a new format, combining both an open call for papers and a workshop on semantic annotation.
