We are pleased to announce that the 7th Conference on Global WordNet
will be held in Tartu (Estonia) on 25th until 29th January 2014. This
conference follows up the previous conferences held in India (2002,
2010), in Czech Republic (2004), in Korea (2006), in Hungary (2008),
and in Japan (2012).

WordNet is a lexical-semantic database, which resembles a thesaurus,
in that it groups words together based on their meanings. Wordnets are
considered as a valuable resource for natural language
processing. Currently there exist wordnets for more than 60
languages. The conference aims to bring together linguists, computer
linguists and language technologists who are interested in the
connections of language and computers.
