This ESSLLI 2011 workshop, endorsed by FlareNet, aims at sketching a large picture of the state of the art in the domain of lexical resource modeling and development. It is also dedicated to research on the application of lexical resources for improving corpus-based studies and language processing tools, both in NLP and other language-related fields, such as linguistics, translation studies and didactics.
