The workshop aimed to bring together members of the language-
resource (LR) landscape, focusing on complex linguistic knowledge 
that requires linguistic expertise, e.g. on dictionaries, ontologies and 
grammars. Such manually-built resources are key to the development 
of natural language processing (NLP) tools and applications. The 
workshop intended to strengthen the cohesion of the scientific 
‘production chain’ spanning from the construction of LRs by linguists 
to their exploitation in hybrid or symbolic NLP. It is necessary to 
increase mutual awareness between researchers along this 
production chain, regarding their activities, skills and needs, in view 
of improving the building processes of the resources, their validation 
and their exploitation.
