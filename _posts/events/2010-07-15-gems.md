GEMS 2010 is the second edition of the GEMS workshop series, focusing on distributional methods and word spaces models for lexical semantics. Our main goal is once again to stimulate research on semantic spaces and distributional methods for NLP, by adopting an interdisciplinary approach to allow a proper exchange of ideas, results and resources among often independent communities. The workshop aims at gathering contemporary contributions to large scale problems in meaning representation, acquisition and use, based on distributional and vector space models. The workshop will also explore the impact of such techniques on complex linguistic tasks, such as linguistic knowledge acquisition, semantic role labeling, textual entailment recognition, question answering, document understanding/summarization and ontology learning.
