The Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) workshop focus on the evaluation of semantic analysis systems. From SemEval-2012 onwards SemEval is part of the *SEM Conference. SemEval has evolved from the SensEval word sense disambiguation evaluation series. The SemEval wikipedia entry (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SemEval>) provides a more detailed historial overview. SemEval-2013 will be the 7th workshop on semantic evaluation. Fourteen tasks have been approved for SemEval-2013.
