The International Conference on Computational Processing of Portuguese
(PROPOR) is the main event in the area of Human Language Processing that
is focused on theoretical and technological issues of written and spoken
Portuguese. The meeting has been a very rich forum for the exchange of
ideas and partnerships for the research communities dedicated to the
automated processing of Portuguese, promoting the development of
methodologies,resources and projects that can be shared among
researchers and practitioners in the field. The conference will
consist of 3 days of paper presentations,special tracks and workshops.

PROPOR is in its 10th edition and it has been hosted in Brazil and in
Portugal: Lisbon/PT (1993), Curitiba/BR (1996), Porto Alegre/BR (1998),
Evora/PT (1999), Atibaia/BR (2000), Faro/PT (2003), Itatiaia/BR (2006),
Aveiro/PT (2008) and Porto Alegre/BR (2010).

TOPICS OF INTEREST

We invite submissions of papers describing work on any topic of language
and speech processing of Portuguese from the industry or academia, including
but not limited to:

1.  Human speech production, perception and communication, including:
Linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language; phonetics,
phonology and morphology; paralinguistic and nonlinguistic cues (e.g.
emotion and expression);

2.  Linguistic Description and Theories: syntactic, semantic, prosodic and
anaphoric phenomena, in (computational) linguistic formalisms like HPSG,
LFG, Categorial Grammars, etc.;

3.  Natural Language Processing Tasks, including: parsing, tagging, chunking
and segmentation, annotation, evaluation, semantic role labelling, grammar
induction, subcategorization acquisition, sentiment analysis and opinion
mining, using symbolic or statistical methods, etc.;

4.  Natural Language Processing Applications, such as word sense
disambiguation dialect identification, machine translation, information
retrieval, plagiarism detection, dialogue systems, question answering,
subtitling, e-learning, etc.;

5.  Speech Technologies, such as spoken language generation and synthesis;
speech and speaker recognition; spoken language understanding;

6.  Speech Applications: Spoken language interfaces and dialogue systems;
systems for information retrieval and information extraction from speech;
systems for speech-speech translation; applications for aged and handicapped
persons; applications for learning and education;

7.  Resources, standardization and evaluation: Spoken language resources,
annotation and tools; Spoken language evaluation and standardization; NLP
resources (raw and annotated corpora, dictionaries, grammars, ontologies,
etc), annotation, tools; NLP evaluation and standardization;

8.  Language and Speech processing in academic disciplines, such as Speech
and Hearing sciences, Psychology, Health, Biology, Linguistics, Cognitive
Sciences, Engineering, Education.

IMPORTANT DATES

*    November 6, 2011 - Deadline for short and full paper submission
*    December 16, 2011 - Notification of acceptance
*    January 15, 2012 - Camera-ready papers due
*    April 17-20, 2012 - Conference

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Authors are
invited to submit two kinds of papers:

*  Full papers: reporting substantial and completed work, especially those
that may contribute in a significant way to the advancement of the area -
wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results should be included.

*  Short papers: reporting ongoing work, position papers and potential ideas
to be discussed.

Authors will be able to express their preference for full/short papers
but the final decision is on the program chairs. Short papers may be
selected for oral or poster presentation and should be up to five (5)
pages of content and one (1) additional page of references in length.
Full papers will be presented in an oral session and should be up to
ten (10) pages of content and two (2) additional pages of references.

Submissions should be written in English. As in previous PROPOR editions,
full papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence (LNAI), the LNCS subseries. Selected short
papers will be taken under consideration for LNAI publication. Papers
must be submitted in PDF, following the LNAI format

(<http://www.springer.de/comp/**lncs/authors.html<http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html>>
),

using Springer Conference Service of PROPOR2012
<http://senldogo0039.springer-**sbm.com/ocs/home/PROPOR2012<http://senldogo0039.springer-sbm.com/ocs/home/PROPOR2012>>

Submissions will be evaluated by at least three reviewers. As reviewing will
be blind, the submission should not include the authors' names and
affiliations, neither contain self-references that reveal identity, like,
"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Instead, use citations such as
"Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Submissions that do not conform to
these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author
identification information is required as part of the submission process.
