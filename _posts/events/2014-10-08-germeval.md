Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been shown useful for a wide range of NLP 
tasks from Information Extraction to Speech Processing. 
For Semantic Web applications like entity linking, NER is a crucial preprocessing 
step.
Even though German is a relatively well-resourced language, NER for German has 
been challenging, both because capitalization is a less useful feature than in 
other languages, and because existing training data sets are encumbered by 
license problems. Therefore, no publicly available NER taggers for German exist 
that are free of usage restrictions and perform at high levels of accuracy.

The GermEval 2014 NER Shared Task is an event that makes available CC-
licensed German data with NER annotation with the goal of significantly 
advancing the state of the art in German NER and to push the field of NER 
towards nested representations of named entities. 

We invite all researchers and industry professionals to participate in the 
challenge and to demonstrate their capabilities of creating a Named Entity 
Recognition system for German. The systems will be evaluated on a manually 
created testset. Training data and development data will be provided. There are 
no restrictions regarding the type of NER system submissions, and no 
restrictions on the use of external data, background corpora, lexical resources 
etc.

GermanEval 2014 NER is associated with the KONVENS 2014 conference and will 
take place as a KONVENS workshop at Hildesheim in October 2014.
