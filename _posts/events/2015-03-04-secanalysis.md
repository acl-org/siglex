Increasingly, sophisticated techniques from machine learning, data mining, statistics and natural language processing are being applied to challenges in security and privacy fields. However, experts from these areas have no medium where they can meet and exchange ideas so that strong collaborations can emerge, and cross-fertilization of these areas can occur. Moreover, current courses and curricula in security do not sufficiently emphasize background in these areas and students in security and privacy are not emerging with deep knowledge of these topics. Hence, we are organizing a workshop that will address the research and development efforts in which 
analytical techniques from machine learning, data mining, natural language processing and statistics are applied to solve security and privacy challenges ("security and privacy analytics"). Submissions of papers related to 
methodology, design, techniques and new directions for security and privacy that make significant use of machine learning, data mining, statistics or natural language processing are welcome. Furthermore, submissions on 
educational topics and systems in the field of security and privacy analytics are also highly encouraged.
