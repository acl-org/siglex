The goal of the “Corpus-based Approaches to Paraphrasing and Nominalization” workshop is to discuss different corpus-based approaches to the automatic processing of paraphrases and nominal structures. This workshop also aims to evaluate to what extent the analysis of paraphrases and nominal structures can improve the quality of NLP applications. Finally, this workshop might constitute a platform for the exchange of resources and tools derived from research projects.  Although paraphrasing and nominalization are established as independent research fields, there exists a close connection between them: nominalizations can be understood as a kind of paraphrase. 
We believe there is a need to bring together linguists and computer scientists, and we invite unpublished contributions related to issues in these fields with a special emphasis on –though not limited to: 
 *      Paraphrasing: scope and typology 
 *      Methods for paraphrase extraction, recognition and generation 
 *      Paraphrase corpora compilation 
 *      Formalisms for paraphrase representation 
 *      Multilingual paraphrasing 
 *      Nominalization as a paraphrase subtype 
 *      Nominalizations: analysis and classification 
 *      Semantic Role Labelling for nominalization argument structure 
 *      Recognition and interpretation of nominalizations 
 *      Distribution of semantic selations among NPs, specially nominalized NPs 
 *      Nominalizations in support verb constructions
