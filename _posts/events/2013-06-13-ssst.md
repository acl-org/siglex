The Seventh Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-7) seeks to build on the foundations established in the first six SSST workshops, which brought together a large number of researchers working on diverse aspects of structure, semantics and representation in relation to statistical machine translation. Its program each year has comprised high-quality papers discussing current work spanning topics including: new grammatical models of translation; new learning methods for syntax- and semantics-based models; formal properties of synchronous/transduction grammars (hereafter S/TGs); discriminative training of models incorporating linguistic features; using S/TGs for semantics and generation; and syntax- and semantics-based evaluation of machine translation.
