The main purpose of this workshop is to review, analyze and discuss the latest developments in semantic analysis of text. It can also be seen as a intermediate workshop between the last Semantic Evaluation exercise and workshop (SemEval-2007) and the preparation for the next SemEval in 2010 (which already launched a call for task proposals). The workshop targets at papers describing both Semantic Processing systems and evaluation exercises.
