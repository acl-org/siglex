In comparison to English and a number of widely spoken languages of Europe, languages of South East Asia and the Oceanic regions are relatively under-resourced in the development of natural language processing applications. As 
such, the text processing for these languages requires a more linguistically informed approach, incorporating more knowledge about the structure and meaning of the language.

This workshop aims to spark a more cross-disciplinary approach to computational linguistics, and natural language processing, as well as contribute to the body of work that applies computational methods to inform, as well as drive linguistic analysis.
